1. Turn on metasploitable.

2. Fill in correct meta_ip in webCrawler.py.

3. Run webCrawler on kali and make sure dirs.txt is in the same dir as webCrawler.py.

   I estimate that the program takes around 20 minutes to go through the entire file
   <Response [200]> Means that the subdomain exists. I got 26 posetive responses from
   the dirs.txt file.
